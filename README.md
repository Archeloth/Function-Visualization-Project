# Function-Visualization-Project
A little project that makes it easy to represent basic mathematical functions.

It just takes a little programming knowledge to translate from the textbook format. Ex: f(x) = 2x in this project would be 2*x, or x^2 would be Math.pow(x,2). Currently works only in the -300, +300 interval.
